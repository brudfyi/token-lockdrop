# Lockdrop frontend demo app

This web app provides the user an interface to connect a Flow wallet and interact with the FLOW lockdrop smart contract.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn copy-env`

Copies the necessary .env variables from .env.template to be able to run the project.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\

Don't forget to run `yarn copy-env` first to set default environment variables needed for
the frontend to work correctly.

For working with the demo app, we recommend using the [lilico](https://lilico.app/) wallet extension, configured for testnet.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
